This app fetches posts from a Facebook page that I, Susanna Alice
Johnson-Chelaru, own: https://www.facebook.com/MusicwithMsJohnson/. It does not
collect, store, or process any personal information. The app only accesses
publicly available posts from the page and presents them to users. No sensitive
or private data is used or stored by the app.

By using this app, users are accessing publicly available content that can be
viewed on Facebook. The app does not share or sell any data.

For questions or concerns, please contact me at susanna.alice.j@gmail.com, or
the page developer, Florin Chelaru, at florin.chelaru@gmail.com.
